## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved my understanding of **CSS Grid and Flexbox** to build responsive layouts.  
Also practiced using **CSS variables** for colors and applied **hover effects** to buttons.

Here’s a small CSS snippet I’m proud of:

```css
.card {
  border-radius: 12px 12px 0 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

I’d like to continue improving at:

- Perfecting responsive layouts
- Mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox combinations
- Writing cleaner, scalable CSS with BEM methodology
